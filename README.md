# 🎓 Results/Performance Management System (SaaS, Multi-Tenant)

A scalable and extensible academic results/performance management system designed for multiple schools (tenants) to manage student assessments, reports, and performance metrics securely and efficiently.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django + Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Shared-database with schema-based isolation using [django-tenants](https://django-tenants.readthedocs.io/)
- **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose
- **Frontend:** React (To be implemented)
- **CI/CD Ready:** Dockerized setup allows deployment to platforms like Render, Azure, Heroku, or DigitalOcean

## ⚙️ Feature-by-Feature Implementation Guide

Below is the recommended implementation order for building this system:

### 1. 🔧 Tenant Setup
- Install & configure `django-tenants`
- Create `Tenant` & `Domain` models
- Set up middleware, routing, and schema migration

### 2. 🧑‍💼 User & Role Management
- Create custom User model
- Implement Role model (`Role`, `UserRole`)
- Set up permissions using Django’s permission system
- Admin can assign multiple roles to a user

### 3. 🏫 Student Module
- Register and manage students (fields: name, gender, class, etc.)
- Link students to a tenant (school)
- View student details by class and stream

### 4. 📊 Results Module
- Record marks for each subject per student
- Link marks to terms, years, and teachers
- Calculate averages and aggregates
- Handle grading logic per school

### 5. 📄 Reports Module
- Generate report cards per term, year
- Print-friendly PDF views of student reports
- Include comments, grades, class positions

### 6. 📈 Analytics
- Performance trends per student/class
- Compare current vs previous term results
- Subject-wise performance charts

### 7. 🔐 Authentication & Security
- JWT or session-based authentication
- Restrict access by tenant
- Password reset and change

### 8. 🧪 Testing & CI/CD
- Write unit and integration tests for each app
- Add GitHub Actions
- Automate Docker builds and deployment

### 9. 🖼️ Frontend (React - Later Phase)
- Implement login, dashboard, and components for each feature
- Consume REST API from Django backend
- Use role-based routing
